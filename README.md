# historic-buildsystem
These is the historic build system previously used to build [neutrino-mp][] for various platforms.
It should not be used anymore and is just deposited here for education and archiving.

Nowadays I'm recommending to use [Yocto][]/[OpenEmbedded][], meta-layers for various set-top-boxes and for neutrino-mp are available from my [github.com home page](https://github.com/seife?tab=repositories).

I'm still not totally ruling out occasional commits with fixes / updates to this repository, as it might still be useful in corner cases, but don't count on that :-)

Have a lot of fun...
